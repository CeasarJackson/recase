# Changelog

### Breaking changes

- `snake_case` now removes punctuation, see [#5](https://github.com/sobolevn/recase/issues/5)
- Minimal `elixir` version is now `1.5`


## Version 0.2.0

This version brings just one, but braking change. As it was discussed `to_upper` is a misleading name for a function. It is not clear what this function does. Since traditionally `uppercase` is just all uppercased letters. And it has nothing to do with `PascalCase`.

### Braking changes

- `UpperCase` renamed to `PascalCase` ([#2](https://github.com/sobolevn/recase/issues/2))
- `Recase.to_upper/1` renamed to `Recase.to_pascal/1` ([#2](https://github.com/sobolevn/recase/issues/2))
